For your course content, and for each video, you can select either:

====================================

The All Rights Reserved license indicates to learners that you own the
copyright for course content and videos. Learners cannot reuse or republish

Creative Commons License

The Creative Commons license allows learners to share and reuse course content
and videos.

When you select a Creative Commons license for your course or a video, you
select from four options:

* **Attribution**, which allows others to copy, distribute, display and perform
  your copyrighted work but only if they give credit the way you request. This
  is enabled for all Creative Commons licenses. You cannot clear this option.

* **Noncommercial**, which allows others to distribute, display and perform
  your work -- and derivative works based upon it -- but for non-commercial
  purposes only.

* **No Derivatives**, which allows others to distribute, display and perform
  only verbatim copies of your work, not derivative works based upon it.

* **Share Alike**, which allows others to distribute derivative works only
  under a license identical to the license that governs your work.

See the `Creative Commons website`_ for more information.
