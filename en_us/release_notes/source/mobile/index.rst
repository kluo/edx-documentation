The edX mobile app is now available for iPhone and Android smartphones. With
the app, you can view or download video lectures for your courses and watch
them any time without requiring an Internet connection. Many of the courses
that are currently running on edx.org are ready for use with the app, and
preparations to support mobile delivery are in progress for even more courses.

You and your students can download the free edX mobile app from Google play
for Android smartphones and from the App Store for Apple iPhones. For answers
to frequently asked questions about the mobile app, see `The edX Mobile App`_
in the *Student Guide*.
