Users who have not yet activated their edx.org accounts can now reset their
passwords on the edx.org site. Previously, those users received an error
message if they tried to reset their passwords before activating their
accounts. (ECOM-894)

* Students who had enrolled in a verified course were erroneously prompted to
  verify their identity if their edX verification expired after the course's
  verification deadline. This problem is resolved. (ECOM-864)

* Students using Internet Explorer 9 without Flash installed were able to click
  disabled buttons and proceed through the verification process, though no
  photo was taken. Students now cannot proceed until they install Flash.
