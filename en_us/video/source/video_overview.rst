Video Processing Overview

Videos are one of the most important assets of an online course. Making
course videos available to learners who are located all over the world, and
who are accessing course content with different devices and Internet
connectivity constraints, can be a complex undertaking.

* For a video to play at locations around the world, it needs to be available
  from more than one host site. 

* For a video to play on different devices, including both desktop computers
  and smartphones, it needs to be available in several different formats.

To help course teams at partner institutions meet the challenge of delivering
high quality video experiences to as many learners as possible, edX offers
media hosting services to address alternative playback and download needs.

~~~

* The edX media team establishes accounts for you at YouTube and Amazon Web
  Services (AWS).

* To ensure optimal playback quality for the original video files that your
  course teams upload, the edX media team uses an automated process to create
  multiple file formats.

After these services are set up for your institution and course, course teams
only need to upload a single file to Studio for each of the videos they want
to include in their course. EdX completes the encoding and hosting process for
your video files.

.. note:: The edX automation process does not include captioning services. 
 Your course teams use your institution's current workflow to generate
 transcripts for your video files. See the section on `creating a video
 transcript`_ in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

After video files upload successfully,
an automated process starts to create additional file formats and transfer the
files to YouTube and AWS, so that the videos are ready for learners to access
and download. The automated process takes 24 hours to complete. Course teams
can track file status on the Studio **Video Uploads** page as the videos
upload to edX and then go through automated processing.
